<h1>Walking Skeleton Service</h1>
<p>Microservice Walking skeleton that is trying to integrate towards some free Soap WebServices (unfortunately they
    don't always work...) and exposing them via rest API. This project is work in progress application and there is
    a lot of TODOs on the way! Wanna help -> create pull request!</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/walking-skeleton/api-docs?/url=/walking-skeleton/swagger.json" >Swagger UI</a></li>
    <li><a href="/walking-skeleton/swagger.json" >swagger.json</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>TODO</h2>
<p>If done with todo item, just move it to Skeleton Features list</p>
<ul>
    <li>Why CXF is creating clients that returns String???</li>
    <li>Find better way to return rest response instead of building always ok response!</li>
    <li>Add example data mapper between soap <-> rest request/response with unit tests!</li>
    <li>Add Eureka client dependency, annotation, settings in application.properties</li>
    <li>Add profiles to application and find convenient way to spin application with different profiles (default profile?)</li>
    <li>Add url configuration for Weather soap client to application.properties</li>
    <li>Add timeout configuration for Weather soap client to application.properties</li>
    <li>Add try/catch block to Weather soap client call</li>
    <li>Add catch exceptions to Weather soap client: SOAPFault, TimeOut, UnknownHost, other</li>
    <li>Add error message response (rest) handler for all errors including exceptions, return http standard code + error message with root cause</li>
    <li>Add and setup logback for rolling file appender, split logs into separate files (communication, errors, spring, ...)</li>
    <li>Add tracing of requests/response and related logs (threads, headerID, ???)</li>
    <li>Add to integration-test resource to pom</li>
    <li>Add integration test with WireMock</li>
    <li>Add Jacoco for unit test and integration test, add merge report</li>
    <li>Add build info in pom and update index.html</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skeleton Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Basic index.html at service root (localhost:port)</li>
    <li>Logging to console request and response from Rest endpoints with pretty print</li>
    <li>Logging to console request and response from CXF soap client with pretty print</li>
    <li>Basic SOAP CXF client generation based on Microsoft Weather Service</li>
    <li>Swagger Rest endpoints definition file</li>
    <li>Swagger UI</li>
    <li>Spring Actuator endpoint security disabled</li>
</ul>

<h2>To discuss</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Find a way to configure globally pretty print for soap clients instead of using private method in WeatherServiceConfig. Temporary solution: CxfSoapClient custom abstract class - don't like it...</li>
    <li>Does CXF soap client creation need RequestScope definition</li>
</ul>
